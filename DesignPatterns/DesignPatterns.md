# Design Patterns

---

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices, providing a way to structure code in a way that's reusable, maintainable, and understandable. Patterns can be classified into three types: creational (for object creation), structural (for object relationships), and behavioral (for object interactions and responsibility distribution).

## Gamma categorization

---
> **Important**
> The "Gamma categorization" refers to the classification of design patterns proposed in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma and others. It categorizes design patterns into three types:

- Creational Patterns
  - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
  - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)
- Structural Patterns
  - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class’ interface
  - Stress the importance of good API design
- Behavioral Patterns
  - They are all different; no central theme
