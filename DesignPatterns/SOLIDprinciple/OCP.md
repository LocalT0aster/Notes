# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

---

> According to this principle, software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new features or functionality to a module without altering its source code. This helps in preventing issues that can arise from changes in the existing functionality.
