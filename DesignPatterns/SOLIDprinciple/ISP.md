# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

---

> **Important**
> This principle suggests that clients (or, more generally, users of interfaces) shouldn't be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Essentially, it's better to have many specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface. This helps to prevent the issues that arise when a change in a rarely used interface breaks the classes that don't use it.
