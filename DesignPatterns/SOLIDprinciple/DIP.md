# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

---

> **Important**
> This principle advises developers to avoid hard-coding dependencies on lower-level modules directly into higher-level modules, but instead to depend on abstractions (like interfaces or abstract classes). In practice, this often means using techniques such as dependency injection, where dependencies are "injected" into a class from an external source. This leads to more flexible and reusable code.
