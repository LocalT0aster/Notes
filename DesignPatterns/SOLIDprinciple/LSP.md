# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

---

> **Important**
> This principle extends the Open-Closed Principle by focusing on the behavior of a superclass and its subclasses. It states that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior. This means that a subclass should enhance, not change, the behavior of the superclass.
