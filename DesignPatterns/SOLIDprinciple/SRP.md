# Single responsibility principle (SRP)

---

> **Important**
> This principle suggests that a class should have only one job or responsibility. This doesn't mean that each class should have only one method, but rather that all the methods in a class should relate to a single purpose. By following this principle, it becomes easier to maintain and modify the class as changes will only be required when there's a change to the responsibility of the class.
