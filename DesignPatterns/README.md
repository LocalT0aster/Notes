# Design Patterns

---

Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices, providing a way to structure code in a way that's reusable, maintainable, and understandable. Patterns can be classified into three types: creational (for object creation), structural (for object relationships), and behavioral (for object interactions and responsibility distribution).

# Gamma categorization

---

The "Gamma categorization" refers to the classification of design patterns proposed in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma and others. It categorizes design patterns into three types:

- Creational Patterns
    - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
    - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
    - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)
- Structural Patterns
    - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
    - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class’ interface
    - Stress the importance of good API design
- Behavioral Patterns
    - They are all different; no central theme
