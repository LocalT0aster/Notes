## Demo

1. (5 points) Use Newton-Raphson to determine the extreme points of the following function.
   $$
   f(x1, x2)=...
   $$
   Hint: use (−, −) and (−, −) as starting points and write − iterations.
2. Consider the problem
   $$
   \text{Maximize }
   f(x,y,z)= ...\\
   \text{subject to }
   \begin{cases}
   g_1(x, y, z) = ... = 0\\
   g_2(x, y, z) = ... = 0
   \end{cases}
   $$
   - **a.** (4 points) Use Jacobian method to solve the problem using x and y as dependent variables and apply the sufficient condition to determine the type of the resulting stationary point.
   - **b.** (1 point) Determine the sensitivity coefficients given the solution in previous part.
   - **c.** (5 points) Verify your answers for previous parts using Lagrangian method.
3. (5 points) (Extra points) Use the sufficiency condition to identify the extreme points.
   $$
   f(x,y)=...
   $$
