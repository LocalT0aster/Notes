# Introduction

## What is optimization

- What is Optimization?
  - Process or method to minimize or maximize a given quantity.
  - This quantity is expressed by a mathematical function that depends on some parameters.
- Why do we study these kind of problems?
  - Many practical applications in different disciplines (computer science, physics, economy, â€¦) can be expressed as Optimization problems.
  - Human intension is not just to solve a problem, but obtain the optimal solution.
- How does Optimization work?
  - Optimization problems are formulated using mathematical functions.
  - Criteria for existence and uniqueness of optima are derived by mathematical techniques.
  - Solution algorithms are iterative and approximate.
  - Convergence speed and accuracy are issues
- What if we know about Optimization?
  - We can use these methods and techniques for all kind of engineering and scientific problems.
  - We can improve these methods and adapt them for special problems.
