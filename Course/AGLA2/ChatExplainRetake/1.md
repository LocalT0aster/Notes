## Explanation

Certainly! The determinant is a special scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It has many important properties and applications in linear algebra, including solving systems of linear equations, finding the inverse of a matrix, and determining the volume scaling factor of linear transformations.

Here are some key properties of determinants:

1. **Determinant of a Square Matrix**: Only square matrices (matrices with the same number of rows and columns) have a determinant.

2. **Multiplicative Property**: The determinant of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of their determinants:

   $$
   \det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)
   $$

3. **Determinant of a Transpose**: The determinant of a matrix and its transpose are the same:

   $$
   \det(A) = \det(A^T)
   $$

4. **Effect of Elementary Row Operations**:
   - **Swapping two rows** of a matrix multiplies the determinant by $-1$.
   - **Multiplying a row** by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar.
   - **Adding a multiple of one row to another row** does not change the determinant.

5. **Determinant of a Triangular Matrix**: The determinant of a triangular matrix (upper or lower) is the product of its diagonal elements.

6. **Zero or Singular Matrix**: If a matrix has a row or column of zeros, its determinant is zero. Furthermore, a matrix is singular (non-invertible) if and only if its determinant is zero.

7. **Determinant of a Block Matrix**: For block matrices, the determinant can sometimes be calculated through determinants of its block components, under certain conditions.

8. **Linear Dependence**: A matrix has a determinant of zero if and only if its rows or columns are linearly dependent.

9. **Determinant of an Inverse**: The determinant of the inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix (provided the matrix is invertible):

   $$
   \det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
   $$

10. **Laplace Expansion**: The determinant can be computed by expanding it along a row or a column using cofactors.

11. **Scalar Multiplication**: If you multiply a matrix by a scalar $ k $, the determinant is multiplied by $k^n$, where $n$ is the number of rows (or columns).

12. **Determinant of a Matrix with Linearly Dependent Rows or Columns**: If a matrix has linearly dependent rows or columns, its determinant is zero.

These properties often serve as shortcuts to calculating the determinant of a matrix, rather than having to compute it through more laborious methods like expansion by minors for larger matrices. Would you like to go through an example of calculating a determinant or discuss any of these properties in more detail?

## Solution

1. If a 4x4 matrix has a $det(A)=1/2$, find $det(2A)$, $det(-A)$, $det(A^2)$, and $det(Aâˆ’1)$.

Let's use the properties of determinants to find the values you're asking for. Here's how you can compute each one:

1. $\det(2A)$:
When you multiply a matrix by a scalar, the determinant of the resulting matrix is the scalar raised to the power of the size of the matrix, multiplied by the determinant of the original matrix.

For a $4 \times 4$ matrix $A$ and scalar $2$, the determinant of $2A$ is:
$$\det(2A) = 2^4 \cdot \det(A) = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 8$$

2. $\det(-A)$:
Similarly, for the scalar $-1$:
$$\det(-A) = (-1)^4 \cdot \det(A) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$

3. $\det(A^2)$:
Using the multiplicative property of the determinant for the product of two matrices (in this case, $A$ with itself):
$$\det(A^2) = \det(A) \cdot \det(A) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$$

4. $\det(A^{-1})$:
The determinant of the inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix:
$$\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2$$
