## Explanation

Certainly! Circulant matrices are a special kind of square matrix where each row is a cyclic shift to the right of the row above it. The concept of circulant matrices comes from the mathematical field of linear algebra and has applications in various areas such as signal processing, image processing, and solving systems of linear equations.

Here's how a circulant matrix looks like:

$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
c_0 & c_{n-1} & \cdots & c_2 & c_1 \\
c_1 & c_0 & c_{n-1} &  & c_2 \\
\vdots & c_1 & c_0 & \ddots & \vdots \\
c_{n-2} &  & \ddots & \ddots & c_{n-1} \\
c_{n-1} & c_{n-2} & \cdots & c_1 & c_0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1}$ are the elements of the first row of the matrix.

Circulant matrices have several interesting properties:

1. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The eigenvectors of a circulant matrix are the discrete Fourier basis, and the eigenvalues can be computed using the discrete Fourier transform of the first row of the matrix.

2. **Diagonalization**: A circulant matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix (the Fourier matrix) and a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

3. **Commutativity**: Any two circulant matrices of the same size can be multiplied together in either order - they commute.

4. **Multiplication**: The product of two circulant matrices is also a circulant matrix.

5. **Determinant and Trace**: The determinant and trace of a circulant matrix can be computed from its eigenvalues.

6. **Inverse**: If a circulant matrix is non-singular, its inverse is also circulant.

7. **Symmetry**: Circulant matrices are symmetric with respect to their secondary diagonal (also called persymmetric).

8. **Toeplitz Structure**: Every circulant matrix is also a Toeplitz matrix, which means each descending diagonal from left to right is constant.

9. **Convolution**: Multiplying a circulant matrix by a vector is equivalent to convolving the first row of the matrix with the vector.

These properties make circulant matrices very useful in computational mathematics because they can simplify problems and algorithms, particularly those that can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to speed up computations.

## Solution

7. Find eigenvector of the circulant matrix $C$ for the eigenvalue $\lambda=c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4$ (12 pts.)
   $$
   C=\begin{bmatrix}
   c_1 & c_2 & c_3 & c_4 \\
   c_4 & c_1 & c_2 & c_3 \\
   c_3 & c_4 & c_1 & c_2 \\
   c_2 & c_3 & c_4 & c_1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

To find the eigenvector corresponding to a given eigenvalue $\lambda = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4$ for the circulant matrix $C$, we need to solve the following equation for the vector $\mathbf{x}$:

$$
(C - \lambda I) \mathbf{x} = 0
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same dimension as $C$. Let's perform this calculation step by step.

First, we'll construct the matrix $C - \lambda I$ using the given circulant matrix $C$ and eigenvalue $\lambda$. Then, we'll solve the homogeneous system of linear equations to find the eigenvector $\mathbf{x}$.

The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4$ for the circulant matrix $C$ is:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This means that any scalar multiple of this vector is also an eigenvector for the given eigenvalue. Eigenvectors are not unique; they can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. The vector we found is often called the "principal eigenvector" since its components are all ones.
