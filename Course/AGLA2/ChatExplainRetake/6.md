## Explanation

Diagonalization is a powerful tool in linear algebra that involves finding a particular matrix called a diagonal matrix that is similar to a given square matrix. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process and concept:

### What is Diagonalization?

Diagonalization is the process of finding a diagonal matrix $D$ that is similar to a given square matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $D$ are said to be similar if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that

$$
D = P^{-1}AP
$$

The diagonal matrix $D$ will contain the eigenvalues of $A$ on its diagonal, and the matrix $P$ will have the corresponding eigenvectors of $A$ as its columns.

### Why Diagonalize a Matrix?

Diagonal matrices are simpler to work with than most other matrices, especially for:

- Raising matrices to powers
- Computing matrix exponentials
- Solving systems of linear differential equations
- Performing various matrix operations that are computationally easier with diagonal matrices

### How to Diagonalize a Matrix?

To diagonalize a matrix, we follow these general steps:

1. **Find the Eigenvalues**: Solve the characteristic equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ for the matrix $A$, where $\lambda$ represents an eigenvalue and $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $A$.

2. **Find the Eigenvectors**: For each eigenvalue $\lambda$, find the corresponding eigenvector $\vec{v}$ by solving the equation $(A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = 0$.

3. **Form the Matrix $P$**: If $A$ has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors, then matrix $A$ is diagonalizable. Arrange the eigenvectors as columns in a matrix $P$.

4. **Form the Diagonal Matrix $D$**: Place the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal of a matrix $D$.

5. **Verify Diagonalization**: Confirm that $A = PDP^{-1}$.

### Conditions for Diagonalization

A matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if there are enough eigenvectors to form the matrix $P$. In more detail, this means:

- The matrix $A$ must have $n$ distinct eigenvalues for an $n \times n$ matrix, or
- If there are repeated eigenvalues, they must have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to match their algebraic multiplicity.

### Example

Let's say we have a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$. To diagonalize it, we would find the eigenvalues, say $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, and the corresponding eigenvectors $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$. If we can do this, and $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are linearly independent, we would then construct $P$ as $[ \vec{v}_1 \ \vec{v}_2 ]$ and $D$ as $\begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix}$.

## Solution

6. Find $A^{10}$ for the matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix}
    4&3\\
    1&2
    \end{bmatrix}$ (10 pts.)

To find $A^{10}$ for the matrix

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 3 \\
1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

we can use diagonalization, provided that $A$ is diagonalizable. Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. **Find the Eigenvalues**: Solve the characteristic equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$.

2. **Find the Eigenvectors**: For each eigenvalue $\lambda$, find the eigenvector $\vec{v}$.

3. **Construct the Matrix $P$**: Use the eigenvectors as columns to form the matrix $P$.

4. **Construct the Diagonal Matrix $D$**: Place the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the matrix $D$.

5. **Calculate $A^{10}$**: Use the fact that $A = PDP^{-1}$ to compute $A^{10} = PD^{10}P^{-1}$.

Let's start with the first step: finding the eigenvalues of $A$.

The eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are $\lambda_1 = 5$ and $\lambda_2 = 1$. The corresponding eigenvectors (which will form the columns of the matrix $P$) are approximately:

For $\lambda_1 = 5$:

$$
\vec{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
0.9486833 \\
0.31622777
\end{bmatrix}
$$

For $\lambda_2 = 1$:

$$
\vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
-0.70710678 \\
0.70710678
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Next, we'll form the matrix $P$ using these eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix $D$ using the eigenvalues. Then we will compute $A^{10}$ using the diagonalization method.

The matrix $A^{10}$ is calculated as:

$$
A^{10} = \begin{bmatrix}
7324219 & 7324218 \\
2441406 & 2441407
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Each entry in this matrix is the result of raising the original matrix $A$ to the 10th power using the process of diagonalization.
