   1. **Lost Items:** Clearly describe the lost item, including details like color, size, and any distinctive features. Include the location where it was last seen.
   2. **Found Items:** If you find an item, describe it and provide a general location for where it was found. Do not post personal items found within the item unless necessary for identification.
   3. **Found Bank Cards, IDs, etc.:** If you find important personal items like bank cards, IDs, or documents, you must not disclose the sensitive information. You need to ensure sensitive information is not visible in pictures by drawing over it.
   4. **Updates:** If an item is found or claimed, update your post to inform the community.
   5. **Animal Posts:** Posts about shelter-seeking animals are not permitted, as they are not considered 'items'. Please use the designated chat for such posts.
