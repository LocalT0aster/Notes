# Fursona creation steps

1. **Concept and Planning**:

   * [ ] Define the characteristics, personality, and appearance of your fursona.
   * [ ] Collect references or inspiration images that resonate with your concept.

2. **Sketching and Rough Outline**:

   * [ ] Start with a basic sketch to define the pose and proportions.
   * [ ] Don't worry about details; just focus on the general shape and structure.

3. **Refining the Outline**:

   * [ ] Slowly add more details to the sketch, like facial features, fur patterns, clothing, etc.
   * [ ] Adjust and refine the outline until you're satisfied with the overall look.

4. **Line Art**:

   * [ ] Create clean lines over your refined sketch using appropriate tools in Photoshop.
   * [ ] Take your time to make smooth, clear lines that define your fursona's shape.

5. **Color Blocking**:

   * [ ] Add flat colors to different parts of the drawing, like fur, eyes, clothing, etc.
   * [ ] This sets the foundation for shading and detailing later on.

6. **Shading and Texturing**:

   * [ ] Add shading to create depth and dimension.
   * [ ] Experiment with different brushes or techniques to add texture, like fur or fabric details.

7. **Background and Additional Elements**:

   * [ ] Add a background or any accessories, props, or effects that enhance your fursona.

8. **Final Touches and Review**:

   * [ ] Review your drawing, making adjustments as needed.
   * [ ] Add highlights, tweak colors, or add any last details to make it complete.

9. **Celebrate Your Work**:

   * [ ] Save and share your work, if you like, and take a moment to appreciate what you've created.
